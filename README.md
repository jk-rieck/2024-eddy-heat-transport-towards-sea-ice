The model configuration and simulation used to produce the study are described in [ESII_SO-RCSI100.L55_documentation.ipynb](ESII_SO-RCSI100.L55_documentation.ipynb) with more details, e.g. the model namelists and code in [MITgcm_config](MITgcm_config/) 
The post-processing analyses as well as the notebooks to reproduce the figures of the article can be found in [analsyis](analysis/).  
The data to reproduce the figures is found in [data_for_plots](data_for_plots/) along with information on how the data were prepared for the plots [here](data_for_plots/prepare_data_for_plots.ipynb).
